<center>1. Deformation and Strain</center>

When a excessive stress is applied to the body of certain material, the shape of the body would be changed. It is called to **Deformation**. The deformation includes the case of yielding, neckling, and rupture, etc., but in this chapter yielding is the principal subject. In a general sense, <u>the deformation will not be uniform throughout the body</u>, and so the change in geometry of any line segment within the body may vary substantially along its length. So, normally the deformation is measured for a small specimen of a certain material.
