<center>1. Torsional Deformation of a Circular Shaft and Torsion Formula</center>

* Torsional Deformation

Consider a shaft $AB$ subjected at $A$ and $B$ to equal and opposite torques $\mathbf{T}$ and $\mathbf{T'}$.We pass a section perpendicular to the axis of the shaft through some arbitrary point $C$ [Fig. 5.1.].

<center>Fig. 5.1. Shaft subject to torques and a section plane at C</center>

The free-body diagram of portion $BC$ of the shaft must include the elementary shearing forces $d\mathbf{F}$, which are perpendicular to the radius of the shaft. These arise from the torque that portion $AC$ exerts on $BC$ as the shaft is twisted [Fig. 5.2.a]. The conditions of equilibrium for BC require that the system of these forces be equivalent to an internal torque T, as well as equal and opposite to $\mathbf{T'}$ [Fig. 5.2.b].

$$\int \rho dF = T​$$

Since $ dF = \tau dA$, where $\tau$ is the shear stress on the element of area $dA$, we can write

$$\int \rho(\tau dA) = T \tag{5.1.}$$

At first, we have to study how the torsional deformation affects the form of shaft. 

![useful image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandonkim12/brandonkim12.github.io/master/assets/mechanics_of_materials/fig_47.JPG)

<center>Fig. 5.3. Description of Torsional Deformation</center>

At [Fig. 5.3.], we find that when the torque is applied, the longitudinal grid lines originally marked on the shaft tend to distort into a helix, [Fig. 5.3.], that intersects the circles at equal angles. Also, <u>all the cross sections of the shaft will remain flat</u>—that is, they do not warp or bulge in or out—<u>and radial lines remain straight</u> and rotate during this deformation. **Provided the angle of twist is small, then the length of the shaft and its radius will remain practically unchanged.**

* Torsion Formula

Think about the one-end-fixed case, which is stated in [Fig. 5.4.]

![useful image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandonkim12/brandonkim12.github.io/master/assets/mechanics_of_materials/fig_48.JPG)

<center>Fig. 5.4. Description of Torsional Deformation</center>

If the shaft is fixed at one end and a torque is applied to its other end, **then the dark green shaded plane in [Fig. 5.4.a] will distort into a skewed form as shown.** Here a radial line located on the cross section at a distance $x$ from the fixed end of the shaft will rotate through an angle $\phi(x)$. This angle is called *the angle of twist.* It depends on the position $x$ and will vary along the shaft as shown.

In order to understand how this distortion strains the material, we will now isolate a small disk element located at $x​$ from the end of the shaft, [Fig. 5.4.b.]. Due to the deformation, the front and rear faces of the element will undergo rotation—the back face by $\phi(x)​$, and the front face by $\phi(x) + d \phi​$. **As a result, the difference in these rotations, $$d\phi​$$, causes the element to be subjected to a shear strain, $\gamma​$ (see Fig. 5.5.).**

![useful image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandonkim12/brandonkim12.github.io/master/assets/mechanics_of_materials/fig_49.JPG)

<center>Fig. 5.5. The Description for The Relationship Between The Shear Strain and The Angle of Twist</center>

In [Fig. 5.4.], we get the equations that 

$$\rho d \phi=dx\gamma \rightarrow \gamma=\rho \frac{d \phi}{dx} \tag{5.2.}​$$

Since $dx​$ and $$d\phi​$$ are the same for all elements, then $d\phi/dx​$ is constant over the cross section, and (5.1) states that the magnitude of the shear strain varies only with its radial distance r from the axis of the shaft. Since $d\phi/dx = \gamma/\rho = \gamma_{\text{max}}/c​$, then

$$\gamma = \frac{\rho}{c}\gamma_{\text{max}} \tag{5.3.}​$$

Since $\tau = G\gamma​$, we get

$\tau=(\frac{\rho}{c})\tau_{\text{max}} \tag{5.4.}​$

Combining (5.3.) and (5.4.), we get

$$\int \rho(\frac{\rho}{c} \tau_{\text{max}} dA) = T \\ \underset{\text{polar moment of inertia}}{\frac{\tau_{\text{max}}}{c}\underline{\int \rho^2 dA}} = T \tag{5.5.}​$$

Replacing the $\int \rho^2 dA​$ with $J​$, we get

$$\tau_{\text{max}}=\frac{Tc}{J} \tag{5.6.}​$$

$$\text{where}\begin{cases}\tau_{\text{max}} =& \text{the maximum shear stress in the shaft,} \\ & \text{which occurs at its outer surface} \\ T = & \text{the resultant internal torque} \\  & \text{acting at the cross section.} \\  & \text{value is determined from} \\ & \text{the method of sections and} \\ & \text{the equation of moment equilibrium} \\ & \text{applied about the shaft’s} \\ & \text{longitudinal axis} \\ J = & \text{the polar moment of inertia} \\ & \text{of the cross-sectional area} \\ c = & \text{the outer radius of the shaft} \end{cases}​$$

and

$$\tau=\frac{T\rho}{J} \tag{5.7.}$$

Now consider two elements a and b located on the surface of a circular shaft subjected to torsion (Fig. 3.17). Since the faces of element a are respectively parallel and perpendicular to the axis of the shaft, the only stresses on the element are the shearing stresses

$$\tau_{\text{max}}=\frac{Tc}{J}​$$

On the other hand, the faces of element b, which form arbitrary angles with the axis of the shaft, are subjected to a combination of normal and shearing stresses. 

![useful image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandonkim12/brandonkim12.github.io/master/assets/mechanics_of_materials/fig_52.JPG)

<center>Fig. 5.6. Circular shaft with stress elements at different orientations.</center>

Consider the stresses and resulting forces on faces that are at $45^{\circ}​$ to the axis of the shaft. The free-body diagrams of the two triangular elements are shown in [Fig. 5.7.]

![useful image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandonkim12/brandonkim12.github.io/master/assets/mechanics_of_materials/fig_53.JPG)

<center>Fig. 5.7. Forces on faces at 45º to shaft axis</center>

From [Fig. 5.7.a], the stresses exerted on the faces $BC​$ and $BD​$ are the shearing stresses $\tau_{\text{max}}=\frac{Tc}{J}​$. The magnitude of the corresponding shear force is $\tau_{\text{max}}A_0​$, where $A_0​$ is the area of the face. Observing that the components along $DC​$ of the two shear forces are equal and opposite, the force $F​$ exerted on $DC​$ must be perpendicular to that face and is a tensile force. Its magnitude is

$$F=2(\tau_{\text{max}}A_0)\cos45^{\circ}=\tau_{\text{max}}A_0\sqrt{2}\tag{5.8.}​$$

The corresponding stress is obtained by dividing the force F by the area A of face $DC​$. Observing that $A = A_0\sqrt{2}​$,

$$\sigma=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{\tau_{\text{max}}A_0\sqrt{2}}{A_0\sqrt{2}}=\tau_{\text{max}}\tag{5.9.}$$

As we can see in [Fig. 5.6.], **stress on 'a' and 'b'  surface is the same, and therefore Torque $T$ is all the same.**

<br>

<center> 2. Shear Stress Distribution.  </center>

If an element of material on the cross section of the shaft or tube is isolated, then due to the complementary property of shear, equal shear stresses must also act on four of its adjacent faces, as shown in [Fig. 5.8.a.]. As a result, the internal torque T develops a linear distribution of shear stress along each radial line in the plane of the cross-sectional area, and also an associated shear-stress distribution is developed along an axial plane, [Fig. 5.8.b.]

![useful image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandonkim12/brandonkim12.github.io/master/assets/mechanics_of_materials/fig_50.JPG)

<center>Fig. 5.8. Description of Stress Distribution </center>

It is interesting to note that **because of this axial distribution of shear stress, shafts made of wood tend to split along the axial plane when subjected to excessive torque**, Fig. 5–9. 

![useful image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandonkim12/brandonkim12.github.io/master/assets/mechanics_of_materials/fig_51.JPG)

<center>Fig. 5.9. Surficial Failure of Wood - Maximum Shear</center>

This is because wood is an anisotropic material, whereby its shear resistance parallel to its grains or fibers, directed along the axis of the shaft, is much less than its resistance perpendicular to the fibers within the plane of the cross section.

<br>

<center>3. Angle of Twist</center>

Recall that

$$\rho d \phi=dx\gamma \rightarrow \gamma=\rho \frac{d \phi}{dx} \tag{5.2.}$$

and

$$\gamma = \frac{\rho}{c}\gamma_{\text{max}} \tag{5.3.}​$$

and last,

$$\tau_{\text{max}}=\frac{Tc}{J} \tag{5.6.}$$

Combining these formulas,

$$d\phi=\frac{T(x)}{J(x)G(x)}dx \\ \phi=\int_0^L \frac{T(x)}{J(x)G(x)}dx \tag{5.10}$$

Similarly with the axial load case,

$$\phi=\sum \frac{TL}{JG} \tag{5.11}$$

The angle of twist of one end of a shaft or tube with respect to the other end can be determined using the following procedure. 

**Internal Torque.**

* The *internal* torque is found at a point on the axis of the shaft by using the method of sections and the equation of moment equilibrium, applied along the shaft’s axis.
* If the torque varies along the shaft’s length, a section should be made at the arbitrary position x along the shaft and the *internal* torque represented as a function of $x$, i.e., $T(x)$.
* If several constant external torques act on the shaft between its ends, the internal torque in each *segment* of the shaft, between any two external torques, must be determined.

**Angle of Twist.**

* When the circular cross-sectional area of the shaft varies along the shaft’s axis, the polar moment of inertia must be expressed as a function of its position x along the axis, $J(x)$.

* If the polar moment of inertia or the internal torque suddenly changes between the ends of the shaft, then $\phi = \int(T(x)/J(x)G(x)) dx$ or $\phi = TL/JG$ must be applied to each segment for which $J$, $G$, and $T$ are continuous or constant. 

* When the internal torque in each segment is determined, be sure to use a consistent sign convention for the shaft or its segments, such as the one shown in [Fig. 5.10.] Also make sure that a consistent set of units is used when substituting numerical data into the equations.

<center>Fig. 5.10. Sign Convention for The Twist Angle</center>

<br>

<center>4. Statically Indeterminate Torque-Loaded Members</center>

This is also similar to the case for the statically indeterminate members with the axial load. The unknown torques in statically indeterminate shafts are determined by satisfying equilibrium, compatibility, and load–displacement requirements for the shaft.

**Equilibrium.**

* Draw a free-body diagram of the shaft in order to identify all the external torques that act on it. Then write the equation of moment equilibrium about the axis of the shaft.

**Compatibility.**

* Write the compatibility equation. Give consideration as to how the supports constrain the shaft when it is twisted. 

**Load–Displacement.**

* Express the angles of twist in the compatibility condition in terms of the torques, using a load– displacement relation, such as $\phi = TL/JG$.
  • Solve the equations for the unknown reactive torques. If any of the magnitudes have a negative numerical value, it indicates that this torque acts in the opposite sense of direction to that shown on the free-body diagram.

<br>

<center>5. Solid Noncircular Shafts, Thin-walled Tubes, Stress Concentration, and Inelastic Torsion</center>

* Solid Noncircular Shafts

Shafts that have a noncircular cross section are not axisymmetric, and so their cross sections will bulge or warp when the shaft is twisted. Evidence of this can be seen from the way grid lines deform on a shaft  having a square cross section, Fig. 5–23. Because of this deformation, the torsional analysis of noncircular shafts becomes considerably more complicated and will not be discussed in this text. <u>*Using a mathematical analysis based on the theory of elasticity, however, the shear-stress distribution within a shaft of square cross section has been determined.*</u> 

Using the theory of elasticity, **Table 5–1 provides the results of the analysis for square cross sections, along with those for shafts having triangular and elliptical cross sections.** In all cases, the maximum shear stress occurs at a point on the edge of the cross section that is closest to the center axis of the shaft. **Also given are formulas for the angle of twist of each shaft.**

<center>Table. 5.1. Maximum Shear and Angle of Twists for Each Shape</center>

* Thin-Walled Tubes Having Closed Cross Section

In the preceding section we saw that the determination of stresses in noncircular members generally requires the use of advanced mathematical methods. **In thin-walled hollow noncircular shafts, a good approximation of the distribution of stresses in the shaft can be obtained by a simple computation. **Consider a hollow cylindrical member of *noncircular* section subjected to a torsional loading [Fig. 5.11][^+].

![useful image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandonkim12/brandonkim12.github.io/master/assets/mechanics_of_materials/fig_56.JPG)

<center>Fig. 5.11. Thin-walled hollow shaft subject to torsional loading.</center>

While the thickness $t​$ of the wall may vary within a transverse section, it is assumed that it remains small compared to the other dimensions of the member.Now detach the colored portion of wall $AB​$ bounded by two transverse planes at a distance $\Delta x​$ from each other and by two longitudinal planes perpendicular to the wall. Since the portion $AB​$ is in equilibrium, the sum of the forces exerted on it in the longitudinal $x​$ direction must be zero (Fig. 3.48).

 The only forces involved in this direction are the shearing forces $F_A$ and $F_B$ exerted on the ends of portion $AB$. Therefore,

$$\begin{matrix}\sum F_x=0; & F_A - F_B = 0 \end{matrix} \tag{5.12.}​$$

Now express $F_A​$ as the product of the longitudinal shearing stress $\tau_A​$ on the small face at A and of the area $t_A \Delta x​$ of that face:

$$F_A=\tau_A (t_A \Delta x)$$

While the shearing stress is independent of the $x​$ coordinate of the point considered, it may vary across the wall. Thus, $\tau_A​$ represents the average value of the stress computed across the wall. Expressing $F_B​$ in a similar way and substituting for $F_A​$ and $F_B​$ into (5.12), write

$$\begin{matrix}\tau_A (t_A \Delta x) = \tau_B(t_B \Delta x) = 0\\\tau_A t_A = \tau_B t_B\end{matrix} \tag{5.13.}$$

Since $A$ and $B$ were chosen arbitrarily, Eq. (5.13) shows that **the product** $\tau t$ **of the longitudinal shearing stress $\tau$ and the wall thickness $t$ is constant throughout the member.** Denoting this product by $q\text{(shear flow)}$[^++],  we have

$$q = \tau t = \text{constant}\tag{5.14.}​$$

Now detach a small element from the wall portion $AB$ (Fig. 5.12.).

<center>Fig. 5.12. Small stress element from segment</center>

**Since the outer and inner faces are part of the free surface of the hollow member, the stresses are equal to zero.** the stress components indicated on the other faces by dashed arrows are also zero, while those represented by solid arrows are equal. Thus, the shearing stress at any point of a transverse section of the hollow member is parallel to the wall surface (Fig. 5.13.), and its average value computed across the wall satisfies Eq. (5.14.).

![useful image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandonkim12/brandonkim12.github.io/master/assets/mechanics_of_materials/fig_59.JPG)

<center>Fig. 5.13. Direction of shearing stress on cross section</center>

At this point, *an analogy can be made between the distribution of the shearing stresses* $t$ *in the transverse section of a thin-walled hollow shaft* and the distributions of the velocities $v$ in water flowing through a closed channel of unit depth and variable width. While the velocity $v$ of the water varies from point to point on account of the variation in the width $t$ of the channel, the rate of flow, $q = vt$, remains constant throughout the channel, just as $\tau t$ in Eq. (5.14). Because of this, the product $q = \tau t$ is called the shear flow in the wall of the hollow shaft.

We will now derive a relation between the torque $T$ applied to a hollow member and the shear flow $q$ in its wall. Consider a small element of the wall section, of length $ds$ (Fig. 5.14).

![useful image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandonkim12/brandonkim12.github.io/master/assets/mechanics_of_materials/fig_60.JPG)

<center>Fig. 5.14. Shear force in the wall.</center>

The area of the element is $dA = t ds$, and the magnitude of the shearing force $dF$ exerted on the element is

$$dF = \tau dA = \tau(t\,ds)=(\tau t)ds = q\,ds \tag{5.15.}$$

The moment $dM_O$ of this force about an arbitrary point $O$ within the cavity of the member can be obtained by multiplying $dF$ by the perpendicular distance $p$ from $O$ to the line of action of $d\mathbf{F}$.

$$dM_O = p\, dF = p(q\,ds) = q(p\,ds)\tag{5.16.}​$$

But the product $p\,ds​$ is equal to twice the area $d\mathfrak{A}​$ of the colored triangle in [Fig. 5.15.].

![useful image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandonkim12/brandonkim12.github.io/master/assets/mechanics_of_materials/fig_61.JPG)

<center>Fig. 5.15. Infinitesimal area used in finding the resultant torque.</center>

Thus,

$$dM_O = q(2d\mathfrak{A}) \tag{5.17.}$$

Since the integral around the wall section of the left-hand member of Eq. (5.17.) represents the sum of the moments of all the elementary shearing forces exerted on the wall section and this sum is equal to the torque T applied to the hollow member,

$$T=\oint dM_O = \oint q(2d\mathfrak{A})​$$

The shear flow $q​$ being a constant, write

$$T = 2q\mathfrak{A}\tag{5.18.}$$

where $\mathfrak{A}​$ is the area bounded by the center line of the wall cross section (Fig. 5.16.).

![useful image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandonkim12/brandonkim12.github.io/master/assets/mechanics_of_materials/fig_62.JPG)

<center>Fig. 5.16. Area for shear flow.</center>

The shearing stress $\tau$ at any given point of the wall can be expressed in terms of the torque $T$ if $q$ is substituted from Eq. (5.14) into Eq. (5.18). Solving for $\tau$:

$$\tau = \frac{T}{2t\mathfrak{A}} \tag{5.19.}$$

where t is the wall thickness at the point considered and A the area bounded by the center line. Recall that t represents the average value of the shearing stress across the wall. However, for elastic deformations, the distribution of stresses across the wall can be assumed to be uniform, and thus Eq. (5.19.) yields the actual shearing stress at a given point of the wall.

The angle of twist of a thin-walled hollow shaft can be obtained also by using the method of energy. **Assuming an elastic deformation**, it is shown that the angle of twist of a thin-walled shaft of length $L​$ and modulus of rigidity $G​$ is

$$\phi = \frac{TL}{4\mathfrak{A}^2G}\oint\frac{ds}{t}\tag{5.20.}​$$

where the integral is computed **along the center line of the wall section**.

* Stress Concentration

The torsion formula, $\tau_{\text{max}} = Tc/J​$, <u>cannot be applied to regions of a shaft having a sudden change in the cross section</u>, *because the shear-stress and shear-strain distributions in the shaft become complex*. Results can be obtained, however, by using experimental methods or possibly by a mathematical analysis based on the theory of elasticity.

![useful image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandonkim12/brandonkim12.github.io/master/assets/mechanics_of_materials/fig_63.JPG)

<center>Fig. 5.17. K value for the r/d ratio</center>

Similar to the case of axial load, $K = \frac{\tau_{\text{_max}}}{\tau_{\text{_avg}}}$. Then, 

$$\tau_{\text{max}} = K\frac{Tc}{J}\tag{5.21.}$$



* Plastic Deformations in Circular Shafts Made of an Elastoplastic Material

If the torsional loadings applied to the shaft are excessive, then the material may yield, and, consequently, <u>a “plastic analysis” must be used</u> *to determine the shear-stress distribution and the angle of twist*. <u>the shear strains that develop in a circular shaft will vary linearly,</u> from zero at the center of the shaft to a maximum at its outer boundary. This is referred to **"idealized case of a solid circular shaft made of an elastoplastic material".** Since the shear stress $\tau​$ acting on an element of area $dA​$, [Fig. 5.18.] produces a force of $dF = \tau dA​$, then the torque about the axis of the shaft is $dT = \rho dF = \rho(\tau dA)​$.

<center>Fig. 5.18. Diagram To Define The Stress Distribution on The Elasto-Plastic Shaft</center>

For the entire shaft we require

$$T = \int_A \rho \tau dA \tag{5.22.}$$

If the area $dA$ over which $\tau$ acts is defined as a differential ring having an area of $dA = 2\pi \rho d\rho$, Fig. 5.19, then the above equation can be written as

$$T = 2\pi \int_0^c \tau \rho^2 d\rho$$

We will now apply this equation to a shaft that is subjected to two types of torque.

* **Elasto-Plastic Torque.**

Let us consider the material in the shaft to exhibit an elastic perfectly plastic behavior, as shown in [Fig. 5.20.].

$$\tau_{\text{max}}=\frac{Tc}{J} \tag{5.6.}$$

Similar to the case of axial load, the shear stress increases linearly in radial direction until the shear reaches the yielding shear stress.

$$T_Y = \frac{J}{c}\tau_Y \tag{5.23}$$



[^+]:  The wall of the member must enclose a single cavity and must not be slit open. In other words, the member should be topologically equivalent to a hollow circular shaft.
[^++]: The terminology “flow” is used since q is analogous to water flowing through a channel of rectangular cross section having a constant depth and variable width.
