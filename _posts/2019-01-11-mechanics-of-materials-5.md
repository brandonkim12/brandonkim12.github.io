<center>1. Torsional Deformation of a Circular Shaft and Torsion Formula</center>

* Torsional Deformation

Consider a shaft $AB$ subjected at $A$ and $B$ to equal and opposite torques $\mathbf{T}$ and $\mathbf{T'}$.We pass a section perpendicular to the axis of the shaft through some arbitrary point $C$ [Fig. 5.1.].

<center>Fig. 5.1. Shaft subject to torques and a section plane at C</center>

The free-body diagram of portion $BC​$ of the shaft must include the elementary shearing forces $d\mathbf{F}​$, which are perpendicular to the radius of the shaft. These arise from the torque that portion $AC​$ exerts on $BC​$ as the shaft is twisted [Fig. 5.2.a]. The conditions of equilibrium for BC require that the system of these forces be equivalent to an internal torque T, as well as equal and opposite to $\mathbf{T'}​$ [Fig. 5.2.b].

$$\int \rho dF = T​$$

Since $ dF = \tau dA$, where $\tau$ is the shear stress on the element of area $dA$, we can write

$$\int \rho(\tau dA) = T \tag{5.1.}$$

At first, we have to study how the torsional deformation affects the form of shaft.

<center>Fig. 5.3. Description of Torsional Deformation</center>

At [Fig. 5.3.], we find that when the torque is applied, the longitudinal grid lines originally marked on the shaft tend to distort into a helix, [Fig. 5.3.], that intersects the circles at equal angles. Also, <u>all the cross sections of the shaft will remain flat</u>—that is, they do not warp or bulge in or out—<u>and radial lines remain straight</u> and rotate during this deformation. **Provided the angle of twist is small, then the length of the shaft and its radius will remain practically unchanged.**

* Torsion Formula

Think about the one-end-fixed case, which is stated in [Fig. 5.4.]

<center>Fig. 5.4. Description of Torsional Deformation</center>

If the shaft is fixed at one end and a torque is applied to its other end, **then the dark green shaded plane in [Fig. 5.4.a] will distort into a skewed form as shown.** Here a radial line located on the cross section at a distance $x$ from the fixed end of the shaft will rotate through an angle $\phi(x)$. This angle is called *the angle of twist.* It depends on the position $x$ and will vary along the shaft as shown.

In order to understand how this distortion strains the material, we will now isolate a small disk element located at $x​$ from the end of the shaft, [Fig. 5.4.b.]. Due to the deformation, the front and rear faces of the element will undergo rotation—the back face by $\phi(x)​$, and the front face by $\phi(x) + d \phi​$. **As a result, the difference in these rotations, $$d\phi​$$, causes the element to be subjected to a shear strain, $\gamma​$ (see Fig. 5.5.).**

<center>Fig. 5.5. The Description for The Relationship Between The Shear Strain and The Angle of Twist</center>

In [Fig. 5.4.], we get the equations that 

$$\rho d \phi=dx\gamma \rightarrow \gamma=\rho \frac{d \phi}{dx} \tag{5.2.}​$$

Since $dx​$ and $$d\phi​$$ are the same for all elements, then $d\phi/dx​$ is constant over the cross section, and (5.1) states that the magnitude of the shear strain varies only with its radial distance r from the axis of the shaft. Since $d\phi/dx = \gamma/\rho = \gamma_{\text{max}}/c​$, then

$$\gamma = \frac{\rho}{c}\gamma_{\text{max}} \tag{5.3.}​$$

Since $\tau = G\gamma​$, we get

$\tau=(\frac{\rho}{c})\tau_{\text{max}} \tag{5.4.}​$

Combining (5.3.) and (5.4.), we get

$$\int \rho(\frac{\rho}{c} \tau_{\text{max}} dA) = T \\ \underset{\text{polar moment of inertia}}{\frac{\tau_{\text{max}}}{c}\underline{\int \rho^2 dA}} = T \tag{5.5.}​$$

Replacing the $\int \rho^2 dA​$ with $J​$, we get

$$\tau_{\text{max}}=\frac{Tc}{J} \tag{5.6.}​$$

$$\text{where}\begin{cases}\tau_{\text{max}} =& \text{the maximum shear stress in the shaft,} \\ & \text{which occurs at its outer surface} \\ T = & \text{the resultant internal torque} \\  & \text{acting at the cross section.} \\  & \text{value is determined from} \\ & \text{the method of sections and} \\ & \text{the equation of moment equilibrium} \\ & \text{applied about the shaft’s} \\ & \text{longitudinal axis} \\ J = & \text{the polar moment of inertia} \\ & \text{of the cross-sectional area} \\ c = & \text{the outer radius of the shaft} \end{cases}​$$

and

$$\tau=\frac{T\rho}{J} \tag{5.7.}$$

Now consider two elements a and b located on the surface of a circular shaft subjected to torsion (Fig. 3.17). Since the faces of element a are respectively parallel and perpendicular to the axis of the shaft, the only stresses on the element are the shearing stresses

$$\tau_{\text{max}}=\frac{Tc}{J}​$$

On the other hand, the faces of element b, which form arbitrary angles with the axis of the shaft, are subjected to a combination of normal and shearing stresses.

<center>Fig. 5.6. Circular shaft with stress elements at different orientations.</center>

Consider the stresses and resulting forces on faces that are at $45^{\circ}​$ to the axis of the shaft. The free-body diagrams of the two triangular elements are shown in [Fig. 5.7.]

![useful image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandonkim12/brandonkim12.github.io/master/assets/mechanics_of_materials/fig_53.JPG)

<center>Fig. 5.7. Forces on faces at 45º to shaft axis</center>

From [Fig. 5.7.a], the stresses exerted on the faces $BC​$ and $BD​$ are the shearing stresses $\tau_{\text{max}}=\frac{Tc}{J}​$. The magnitude of the corresponding shear force is $\tau_{\text{max}}A_0​$, where $A_0​$ is the area of the face. Observing that the components along $DC​$ of the two shear forces are equal and opposite, the force $F​$ exerted on $DC​$ must be perpendicular to that face and is a tensile force. Its magnitude is

$$F=2(\tau_{\text{max}}A_0)\cos45^{\circ}=\tau_{\text{max}}A_0\sqrt{2}\tag{5.8.}​$$

The corresponding stress is obtained by dividing the force F by the area A of face $DC​$. Observing that $A = A_0\sqrt{2}​$,

$$\sigma=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{\tau_{\text{max}}A_0\sqrt{2}}{A_0\sqrt{2}}=\tau_{\text{max}}\tag{5.9.}$$

As we can see in [Fig. 5.6.], **stress on 'a' and 'b'  surface is the same, and therefore Torque $T$ is all the same.**

<center> 2. Shear Stress Distribution.  </center>

If an element of material on the cross section of the shaft or tube is isolated, then due to the complementary property of shear, equal shear stresses must also act on four of its adjacent faces, as shown in [Fig. 5.8.a.]. As a result, the internal torque T develops a linear distribution of shear stress along each radial line in the plane of the cross-sectional area, and also an associated shear-stress distribution is developed along an axial plane, [Fig. 5.8.b.]

<center>Fig. 5.8. Description of Stress Distribution </center>

It is interesting to note that **because of this axial distribution of shear stress, shafts made of wood tend to split along the axial plane when subjected to excessive torque**, Fig. 5–9.

<center>Fig. 5.9. Surficial Failure of Wood - Maximum Shear</center>

This is because wood is an anisotropic material, whereby its shear resistance parallel to its grains or fibers, directed along the axis of the shaft, is much less than its resistance perpendicular to the fibers within the plane of the cross section.

<center>3. Angle of Twist</center>

Recall that

$$\rho d \phi=dx\gamma \rightarrow \gamma=\rho \frac{d \phi}{dx} \tag{5.2.}$$

and

$$\gamma = \frac{\rho}{c}\gamma_{\text{max}} \tag{5.3.}​$$

and last,

$$\tau_{\text{max}}=\frac{Tc}{J} \tag{5.6.}$$

Combining these formulas,

$$d\phi=\frac{T(x)}{J(x)G(x)}dx \\ \phi=\int_0^L \frac{T(x)}{J(x)G(x)}dx \tag{5.10}$$

Similarly with the axial load case,

$$\phi=\sum \frac{TL}{JG} \tag{5.11}$$

The angle of twist of one end of a shaft or tube with respect to the other end can be determined using the following procedure. 

**Internal Torque.**

* The *internal* torque is found at a point on the axis of the shaft by using the method of sections and the equation of moment equilibrium, applied along the shaft’s axis.
* If the torque varies along the shaft’s length, a section should be made at the arbitrary position x along the shaft and the *internal* torque represented as a function of $x$, i.e., $T(x)$.
* If several constant external torques act on the shaft between its ends, the internal torque in each *segment* of the shaft, between any two external torques, must be determined.

**Angle of Twist.**

* When the circular cross-sectional area of the shaft varies along the shaft’s axis, the polar moment of inertia must be expressed as a function of its position x along the axis, $J(x)$.
* If the polar moment of inertia or the internal torque suddenly changes between the ends of the shaft, then $\phi = \int(T(x)/J(x)G(x)) dx$ or $\phi = TL/JG$ must be applied to each segment for which $J$, $G$, and $T$ are continuous or constant. 
* When the internal torque in each segment is determined, be sure to use a consistent sign convention for the shaft or its segments, such as the one shown in Fig. 5–15. Also make sure that a consistent set of units is used when substituting numerical data into the equations.
