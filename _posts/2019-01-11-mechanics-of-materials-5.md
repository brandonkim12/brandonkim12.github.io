<center>1. Torsional Deformation of a Circular Shaft</center>

Consider a shaft $AB$ subjected at $A$ and $B$ to equal and opposite torques $\mathbf{T}$ and $\mathbf{T'}$.We pass a section perpendicular to the axis of the shaft through some arbitrary point $C$ [Fig. 5.1.].

<center>Fig. 5.1. Shaft subject to torques and a section plane at C</center>

The free-body diagram of portion $BC$ of the shaft must include the elementary shearing forces $d\mathbf{F}$, which are perpendicular to the radius of the shaft. These arise from the torque that portion $AC$ exerts on $BC$ as the shaft is twisted [Fig. 5.2.a]. The conditions of equilibrium for BC require that the system of these forces be equivalent to an internal torque T, as well as equal and opposite to $\mathbf{T'}$ [Fig. 5.2.b].

$$\int \rho dF = T \\ \int \rho (\tau dA) = T \\ \tau=\frac{\rho}{c}\tau_{\text{max}} \\ \int \rho(\frac{\rho}{c} \tau_{\text{max}} dA) = T \\ \underset{\text{polar moment of inertia}}{\frac{\tau_{\text{max}}}{c}\underline{\int \rho^2 dA}} = T$$



$$\tau = G\gamma \\ \gamma = \frac{\rho}{c}\gamma_{\text{max}}$$
