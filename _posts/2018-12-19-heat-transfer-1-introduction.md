Why the mechanical engineer should know how the heat and mass is transferred? for mechanical engineers, it is essential for them to analyze:

- how the reaction between the mechanical components
- how the individual component or subsystem endures long for the given conditions
- how much mechanical power transmission occurs by heat and mass transfer

However, we don't know exactly what concept we need to take the heat and mass transfer. So, let us talk together what preliminaries are in need.

More detailed concepts would be found in thermodynamics post, so we just remind the things briefly.

<center>1. Nomenclatures</center>

- System, surroundings and boundary:

  - System: The space of $n$-th dimension, which contains all things what we want to analyze.
  - Surroundings: Everything excluding the system, whose dimension is also $n$-th one.
  - Boundary: The $(n-1)$-th-dimensioned distinguisher between system and surroundings,

  e.g.) Control volume $\rightarrow$ system
  Whole world excluding system $\rightarrow$ surroundings
  Control surface $\rightarrow$ boundary

- Closed and Isolated System

  - Closed system: the system which always contain the same matter - no heat and mass transfer across its boundary.
  - Isolated system: a special type of closed system that does not interact in any way with its surroundings

* Heat transfer (or Heat)
  * Thermal energy in transit due to a spatial temperature difference.
  * Surface transfer phenomena
    There are three types of heat transfer: conduction, convection and radiation
