<center>1. Valve Coefficient</center>

When you design the pneumatic or hydraulic system, according to the Bernoulli's equation in compressible flow situation

$$gh + \frac{1}{2}v^2 + \frac{\int dP}{\rho}=const. \tag{2.1}$$ 

where $\int dP$ is the pressure drop within the measurement time scope. Above term is the mechanical energy of the fluid per unit mass. In many occasion, we can approximate the $\int dP$ into $\Delta P$. As we can see in $(2.1)$,  the pressure drop is very important when you design the pneumatic or hydraulic system, because velocity of the fluid varies with the pressure drop by the valve structure*(installed flow characteristic)*, regardless of whether the height difference could be ignored (height can be measured easily). 

Valve coefficients are to evaluate the performance of the valve according to the pressure drop.

$$C_v\,=Q \sqrt{\frac{S_g}{\Delta P}}$$

where $C_v\,=\,$ required flow coefficient for the valve

​              $Q\,=$ flow rate [gal/min]

​             $S_g\,=$ specific gravity of the fluid

​           $\Delta P\,=$ pressure drop [psi]

when you design the pneumatic or hydraulic system, you would often design with the  Imperial units, so we should be used to take the imperial units system.
