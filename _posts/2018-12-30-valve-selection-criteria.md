<center>1. Valve Coefficient</center>

When you design the pneumatic or hydraulic system, according to the Bernoulli's equation in compressible flow situation

$$gh + \frac{1}{2}v^2 + \frac{\int dP}{\rho}=const. \tag{2.1}$$ 

where $g​$ is the gravity acceleration constant, $h​$ is the height of the fluid line from the reference point, $\rho​$ is the density property of fluid being analyzed, and $\int dP​$ is the pressure drop within the measurement time scope. Above term is the mechanical energy of the fluid per unit mass. 

Usually the closure element, such as a plug or a disk, is located just off the seat, which leads to the possibility of creating a high pressure drop and faster velocities—causing cavitation, flashing, or erosion of the trim parts. In addition, if the closure element is closure to the seat and the operator is not strong enough to hold that position, it may be sucked into the seat. This problem is appropriately called *the bathtub stopper effect*. That's why we have to focus in the $\int dP$. 

In many occasion, we can approximate the $\int dP$ into $\Delta P$. As we can see in $(2.1)$,  the pressure drop is very important when you design the pneumatic or hydraulic system, because velocity of the fluid varies with the pressure drop by the valve structure*(installed flow characteristic)*, regardless of whether the height difference could be ignored (height can be measured easily). Considering that, the valve coefficients are to evaluate the performance of the valve according to the pressure drop.

$$C_v\,=Q \sqrt{\frac{S_g}{\Delta P}} \tag{2.2}$$

where $C_v\,=\,$ required flow coefficient for the valve

​              $Q\,=$ flow rate [gal/min]

​             $S_g\,=$ specific gravity of the fluid

​           $\Delta P\,=$ pressure drop [psi]

when you design the pneumatic or hydraulic system, you would often design with the  Imperial units, so we should be used to take the imperial units system. 



<center>2. Theoretical Background</center>

Let use the HGL(Hydraulic Grade Line) and EGL(Energy Grade Line) to visualize the Bernoulli's equation much easier to understand $(2.2)​$. To do this, Divide $(2.1)​$ by $g​$. Then we can evaluate

$$\underset{Pressure\,Head,\,Velocity\,Head,\,Elevation\,Head,\,and\,Total\,Head\,along\,a\,streamline}{\frac{P}{\rho g}+{\frac{V^2}{2g}+h=H}} \tag{2.3}$$ 

in this case, HGL is the $\frac{P}{\rho g}+h$, and EGL is HGL + $\frac{V^2}{2g}$, so $(2.3)$ is the formula of EGL. Let me show you some of explanation:

* For **stationary bodies** such as reservoirs or lakes, the EGL and HGL coincide with the free surface of the liquid. The elevation of the free surface z in such cases represents both the EGL and the HGL since the velocity is zero and the static (gage) pressure is zero.
* The EGL is always a distance V2/2g above the HGL. These two curves approach each other as the velocity decreases, and they diverge as the velocity increases. The height of the HGL decreases as the velocity increases, and vice versa.
* In an **idealized Bernoulli-type flow**, EGL is horizontal and its height remains constant. This would also be the case for HGL when the flow velocity is constant.
* For **open-channel flow**, the HGL coincides with the free surface of the liquid, and the EGL is a distance V2/2g above the free surface.
* At a **pipe exit**, the pressure head is zero (atmospheric pressure) and thus the HGL coincides with the pipe outlet (location 3 on Fig. 5–35).
* The **mechanical energy loss** due to frictional effects (conversion to thermal energy) causes the EGL and HGL to slope downward in the direction of flow. The slope is a measure of the head loss in the pipe. A component that generates significant frictional effects such as a valve causes a sudden drop in both EGL and HGL at that location.
* A **steep jump** occurs in EGL and HGL whenever mechanical energy is added to the fluid (by a pump, for example). Likewise, a **steep drop** occurs in EGL and HGL whenever mechanical energy is removed from the fluid (by a turbine, for example).
* The gage pressure of a fluid is zero at locations where the HGL intersects the fluid. The pressure in a flow section that lies above the HGL is negative, and the pressure in a section that lies below the HGL is positive. Therefore, an accurate drawing of a piping system overlaid with the HGL can be used to determine the regions where the gage pressure in the pipe is negative (below atmospheric pressure).
