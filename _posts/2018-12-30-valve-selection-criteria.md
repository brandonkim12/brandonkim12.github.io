<center>1. Valve Coefficient</center>

When you design the pneumatic or hydraulic system, according to the Bernoulli's equation in compressible flow situation

$$gh + \frac{1}{2}v^2 + \frac{\int dP}{\rho}=const. \tag{2.1}$$ 

where $\int dP$ is the pressure drop within the measurement time scope. Above term is the mechanical energy of the fluid per unit mass. In many occasion, we can approximate the $\int dP$ into $\Delta P$. As we can see in $(2.1)​$,  the pressure drop is very important when you design the pneumatic or hydraulic system, because velocity of the fluid varies with the pressure drop by the valve structure, regardless of whether the height difference could be ignored (height can be measured easily).
