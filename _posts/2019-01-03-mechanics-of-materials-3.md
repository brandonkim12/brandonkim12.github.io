<center>1. Ductility and Brittleness</center>

**Ductile Materials**: Any material that can be subjected to large strains before it fractures is called a ductile material. Mild steel, as discussed previously, is a typical example. Engineers often choose ductile materials for design *because <u>these materials are capable of absorbing shock or energy</u>*, and *if they become overloaded, they will usually exhibit large deformation before failing*.

Recalling the stress-strain diagram, $\sigma _Y \text{(Yielding Stress)}$ can be found at [elastic limit yield stress] in above figure. The meaning of the $\sigma _Y$ is that *the starting point of plastic deformation.* ***Ductile Material passes this point certainly.*** Through this point and when the ductile material is about to be *necking*, $\sigma _u \text{(Ultimate Stress)}$ the upper limit of the conventional stress-strain diagram. Realize that the yield strength is not a physical property of the material, since it is a stress that causes a specified permanent strain in the material. In this text, however, we will assume that the yield strength, yield point, elastic limit, and proportional limit all coincide unless otherwise stated.

<center>FIg. 3.1. The Diagram of Natural Rubber - Non-linear Elastic Behavior</center>

An exception would be natural rubber, which in fact does not even have a proportional limit, since stress and strain are not linearly related. Instead, as shown in [Fig. 3.1.] this material, which is known as a polymer, exhibits nonlinear elastic behavior. 



**Brittle Materials**: Materials that exhibit little or no yielding before failure are referred to as brittle materials. Gray cast iron is an example, having a stressâ€“strain diagram in tension as shown by the
curve AB in [Fig. 3.2.]

***Brittle Material doesn't undergo the yielding, and it goes to the fracture directly.*** Since the appearance of initial cracks in a specimen is quite random, ***brittle materials do not have a well-defined tensile fracture stress.*** Instead the average fracture stress from a set of observed tests is generally reported. A typical tensile and compressive failure is stated on [Fig. 3.3] and [Fig. 3.4.] below.
