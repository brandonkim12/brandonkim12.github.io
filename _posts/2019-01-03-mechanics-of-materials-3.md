<center>1. Ductility and Brittleness</center>

**Ductile Materials**: Any material that can be subjected to large strains before it fractures is called a ductile material. Mild steel, as discussed previously, is a typical example. Engineers often choose ductile materials for design *because <u>these materials are capable of absorbing shock or energy</u>*, and *if they become overloaded, they will usually exhibit large deformation before failing*.

Recalling the stress-strain diagram, $\sigma _Y \text{(Yielding Stress)}$ can be found at [elastic limit yield stress] in above figure. The meaning of the $\sigma _Y$ is that *the starting point of plastic deformation.* ***Ductile Material passes this point certainly.*** Through this point and when the ductile material is about to be *necking*, $\sigma _u \text{(Ultimate Stress)}$ the upper limit of the conventional stress-strain diagram. Realize that the yield strength is not a physical property of the material, since it is a stress that causes a specified permanent strain in the material. In this text, however, we will assume that the yield strength, yield point, elastic limit, and proportional limit all coincide unless otherwise stated.

<center>FIg. 3.1. The Diagram of Natural Rubber - Non-linear Elastic Behavior</center>

An exception would be natural rubber, which in fact does not even have a proportional limit, since stress and strain are not linearly related. Instead, as shown in [Fig. 3.1.] this material, which is known as a polymer, exhibits nonlinear elastic behavior. 



**Brittle Materials**: Materials that exhibit little or no yielding before failure are referred to as brittle materials. Gray cast iron is an example, having a stressâ€“strain diagram in tension as shown by the
curve AB in [Fig. 3.2.]

 <center>FIg. 3.2. The Diagram of Gray Cast Iron - Brittle Material</center>

***Brittle Material doesn't undergo the yielding, and it goes to the fracture directly.*** Since the appearance of initial cracks in a specimen is quite random, ***brittle materials do not have a well-defined tensile fracture stress.*** Instead the average fracture stress from a set of observed tests is generally reported. A typical tensile and compressive failure is stated on [Fig. 3.3] and [Fig. 3.4.] below.

<center>2. Elastic and Plastic Behavior of a Material</center>

If the material has a well-defined yield point as in [Fig. 3.5], the elastic limit, the proportional limit, and the yield point are essentially equal. In other words, *<u>the material behaves elastically and linearly as long as the stress is kept below the yield point.</u>*

However, if the yield point is reached,  The plastic strain remains, and as a result the material will be subjected to a permanent set. It is a kind of a hysteresis,  which means that **the system is not independent to the process path.**  When the load is removed, the stress and strain decrease in a linear fashion along a line CD parallel to the straight-line portion AB of the loading curve [Fig. 3.6]. We says this process as ***strain hardening***.

<center>FIg. 3.6. Stress-strain response of ductile material loaded beyond yield and unloaded.</center>

If, after being loaded and unloaded [Fig. 3.7.], the test specimen is loaded again, the new loading curve will follow the earlier unloading curve until it almost reaches point C. Then it will bend to the right and connect with the curved portion of the original stress-strain diagram. Then it will bend to the right and connect with the curved portion of the original stress-strain diagram.

<center>FIg. 3.7. Stress-strain response of ductile material
reloaded after prior yielding and unloading.</center>

In abstract, in stress-strain diagram, if the stress acting on a material is below yielding stress, the material behaves elastically and linearly when the exerted stress is below the yielding stress. Exceeding the yielding stress, elastic region starts from D in [Fig. 3.7] Elastic behavior represents which the material is getting recovered below the yielding stress region. If not, it is the plastic behavior.
