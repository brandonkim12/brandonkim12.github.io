<center>1. Ductility and Brittleness</center>

**Ductile Materials: ** Any material that can be subjected to large strains before it fractures is called a ductile material. Mild steel, as discussed previously, is a typical example. Engineers often choose ductile materials for design *because <u>these materials are capable of absorbing shock or energy</u>*, and *if they become overloaded, they will usually exhibit large deformation before failing*.

Recalling the stress-strain diagram, $\sigma _Y \text{(Yielding Stress)}$ can be found at [elastic limit yield stress] in above figure. The meaning of the $\sigma _Y$ is that the starting point of plastic deformation. ***Ductile Material*** passes this point certainly. Through this point and when the ductile material is about to be *necking*, $\sigma _u \text{(Ultimate Stress)}$ the upper limit of the conventional stress-strain diagram.
