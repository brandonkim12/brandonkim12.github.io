<center>1. Saint-Venant's Principle - The First Sssumptions from The Theory of Elasticity</center>

We have shown that the mathematical relationship between stress and strain depends on the type of material from which the body is made. In particular, if the material behaves in a linear elastic manner, then Hookeâ€™s law applies, and there is a proportional relationship between stress and strain. Using this idea, consider the manner in which a rectangular bar will deform elastically when the bar is subjected to the force P applied along its centroidal axis, [Fig. 4.1].
