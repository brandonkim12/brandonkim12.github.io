<center>-1. Stress and Strain</center>

Stress means the force acting on the unit area, such as $\sigma\,=\,\frac{F}{A} [\frac{N}{m}]\,=\,[Pa]$ where $F\,:\,Force,\,A\,=\,Area$, and strain means the difference between the initial length and final length for compared to the initial length, such as $\epsilon\,=\,\frac{L_0\,-\,L_f}{L_0}$. The mechanics of materials are the set of study for the relations between them. 



<center>-2. Preliminaries - statics</center>

* Equations of Equilibrium

Firstly, mechanics of materials deal with the static state, so we have two main formulas such that

$$\begin{align}& \sum \mathbb{F}\,=\,0 \\ & \sum \mathbb{M}_O \,=\,0\end{align}$$

In the most simple coordinates, in other words, cartesian coordinates, generally we deal with the xyz, so the above formula are expressed 6 formulas like below:

$$\begin{align} & \sum F_x\,=\,0, \sum F_y\,=\,0, \sum F_z\,=\,0 \\ & \sum M_x\,=\,0, \sum M_y\,=\,0, \sum M_z\,=\,0\end{align}$$

If you're in the two-dimensional situation, above 6 formulas are to be reduced to 3 formulas such as:

$$\begin{align}&\sum F_x\,=\,0 \\& \sum F_y\,=\,0 \\& \sum M_O\,=\,0 \end{align}$$



* Support Reactions

In statics, support options help us to solve the problem properly, sometimes are critical to define whether the problem could be solved.

<center>-3. Forces used to analyze the stress and strain</center>

* Normal force: Force acts perpendicular to the area. 
* Shear force: Force makes the body to slide over one another.
* Torsional moment (or torque): The moment makes the body twist according to the perpendicular axis to the surface area.
* Bending moment: The moment makes the body bended

Abstract descriptions are below:

In many cases, we're going to deal with this picture:

* Normal Stress: stress for the normal force to a surface. For [Fig.4], $\sigma_z\,=\displaystyle{\lim_{\Delta A \to 0}}\frac{\Delta F_z}{\Delta A}$

* Shear Stress: stress for the shear force to a surface. For [Fig. 4], $\tau_{zx}\,=\displaystyle{\lim_{\Delta A \to 0}}\frac{\Delta F_x}{\Delta A}$,  $\tau_{zy}\,=\displaystyle{\lim_{\Delta A \to 0}}\frac{\Delta F_y}{\Delta A}$

So, stresses are generally expressed like below:
