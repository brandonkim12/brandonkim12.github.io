1] Valves: Mechanical devices specifically designed to direct, start, stop, mix, or regulate the flow, pressure, or temperature of a working fluid. Here is a type of valves - ball valves.

2] Classification for the functions

|     On-Off Valves     |    Nonreturn Valves     |    Throttling Valves     |
| :-------------------: | :---------------------: | :----------------------: |
|      Gate valve       | All of the check valves |  acts as on-off valves   |
|      Plug valve       |                         |    Pressure regulator    |
|      Ball valve       |                         | Automatic control valves |
| Pressure-relief valve |                         |                          |
|   Tank-bottom valve   |                         |                          |

[Table 1. Classification for the functions of each valve]

 * On-off valve

   * Used to start or stop the flow of the medium through the process.

   * A majority of them are operated by hands.

     * Some of them are automated with the addition of actuator.

   * Pressure-relief valve: self-actuated when a preset pressure is surpassed.

     * Relief valve - used for liquid

     * Safety valve - used for gas

* Nonreturn Valves

  * Allow the fluid to flow only in the desired direction.

    * All check valves are non-return valves.

  * Used to prevent backflow of fluid - which can cause the damage to equipment

    * Pump(in liquid application)
    * Compressor(in gas application)
    * Process systems that have varying pressures, which must be kept separate.

* Throttling Valves
