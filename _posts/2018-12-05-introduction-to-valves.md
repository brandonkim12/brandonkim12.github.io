1] Valves: Mechanical devices specifically designed to direct, start, stop, mix, or regulate the flow, pressure, or temperature of a working fluid. Here is a type of valves - ball valves.   [^1]

2] Classification for the functions

|     On-Off Valves     |    Nonreturn Valves     |    Throttling Valves     |
| :-------------------: | :---------------------: | :----------------------: |
|      Gate valve       | All of the check valves |  acts as on-off valves   |
|      Plug valve       |                         |    Pressure regulator    |
|      Ball valve       |                         | Automatic control valves |
| Pressure-relief valve |                         |                          |
|   Tank-bottom valve   |                         |                          |

<center>[Table 1. Classification for the functions of each valve]</center>

 * On-off valve

   * Used to start or stop the flow of the medium through the process.
   * A majority of them are operated by hands. [like Fig. 1.]

     * Some of them are automated with the addition of actuator.
   * Pressure-relief valve: self-actuated when a preset pressure is surpassed.
     * Direct-loaded pressure relief valves[^2]
     * Piloted pressure relief valves
     * Relief valve - used for liquid

     * Safety valve - used for gas

* Nonreturn Valves

  * Allow the fluid to flow only in the desired direction.

    * All check valves are non-return valves.
      * Lift check
      * Swing check
      * Tilting disc
      * Diaphragm

  <center>[Fig 2. Check valve]</center>

  * Used to prevent backflow of fluid - which can cause the damage to equipment

    * Pump(in liquid application)
    * Compressor(in gas application)
    * Process systems that have varying pressures, which must be kept separate.

* Throttling Valves

  * Used to regulate the flow, temperature, or pressure of the service.

  * Can move to any position within the stroke of the valve || hold that position

    * Including the full-open or full-closed positions.
    * So they can act as on-off valve also. [Superset of On-off valve]

  * Commonly hand-operated / some are equipped with actuators or actuation systems.

    * Actuators provide greater thrust and positioning capability, as well as automatic control.

  * Pressure regulators - vary the valve’s position to maintain constant pressure downstream.

  * (Automatic) control valve: commonly used to describe valves that are capable of varying flow conditions to match the process requirements.

    * Equipped with the actuators to achieve automatic control.

* Final Control Elements within a Control Loop

  * Control valve: the most commonly used final control element
  * Needed to provide the power and accuracy to control the flowing medium to the desired service conditions.
  * Part of the control loop - applied to the feedback control
