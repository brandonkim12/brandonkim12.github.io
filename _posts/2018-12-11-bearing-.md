<center>-1. Stress and Strain</center>

Stress means the force acting on the unit area, such as $\sigma\,=\,\frac{F}{A} [\frac{N}{m}]\,=\,[Pa]$ where $F\,:\,Force,\,A\,=\,Area$, and strain means the difference between the initial length and final length for compared to the initial length, such as $\epsilon\,=\,\frac{L_0\,-\,L_f}{L_0}$. The mechanics of materials are the set of study for the relations between them.
